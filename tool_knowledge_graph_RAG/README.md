# Knowledge Graph RAG Tools

This module provides tools specifically designed for integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

These tools enable structured, entity-based retrieval and reasoning to complement or replace traditional vector-based search.

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph RAG system enhances LLM responses by:
- Linking text to structured graph entities
- Retrieving subgraphs based on semantic or relational relevance
- Enabling grounded reasoning and fact-based generation
- Supporting explainability via entity-relation chains
