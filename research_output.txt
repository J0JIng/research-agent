Research indicates that shyness in cats can be attributed to a variety of factors including genetics, socialization experiences during kittenhood, and individual personality traits. Cats that have not been properly socialized may become more timid and less confident in new environments or around new people. Additionally, certain breeds may display shyer behaviors. Understanding a cat's environment and fostering a positive, stress-free space can help manage and reduce shyness.
