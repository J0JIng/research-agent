# Collaborative Filtering in Recommendation Systems

## Summary
Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the two major techniques used by recommender systems, the other being content-based filtering. CF makes predictions about a user's interests by leveraging the preferences or taste information collected from many users. This method operates on the principle that if two users (A and B) share similar opinions on certain items, they are likely to agree on others as well. For example, in a TV programming context, a collaborative filtering system might suggest shows to a user based on the preferences of users who have similar tastes.

### Key Concepts of Collaborative Filtering
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: This method involves finding users with similar interests and recommending items they liked to each other.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: This approach focuses on finding similarities among items, suggesting items similar to those the user has previously liked.

## Recommender Systems
A recommender system, or recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that provides personalized suggestions to users. These systems are particularly useful to help users navigate the overwhelming choices available in modern platforms, such as e-commerce websites or streaming services. 

### Modern Techniques
Modern recommender systems utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, and various algorithms to understand user behavior and preferences, effectively categorizing content to tailor individual user experiences. Recommendations can pertain to various aspects, including:
- Products to purchase
- Music to listen to
- News articles to read

### Applications
Recommender systems are widely applicable across numerous platforms and industries, facilitating better user engagement through personalized experiences.
