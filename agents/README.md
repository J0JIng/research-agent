# Agent

This folder contains the implementation of various agents used in the research pipeline.

## Overview

The core idea is to modularize different functionalities into individual agent classes. These agents can be composed together (e.g., using LangGraph) to form a larger research agent capable of complex tasks like retrieval, summarization, verification, and report generation.
