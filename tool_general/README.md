# General Tools

This folder contains general-purpose tools and utilities that support various agent workflows but are not specific to RAG-based or knowledge graph tools.

## Overview

These tools are designed to be reusable and modular. They provide helper functions, wrappers, or services that can be used across different agents or components in the system.
